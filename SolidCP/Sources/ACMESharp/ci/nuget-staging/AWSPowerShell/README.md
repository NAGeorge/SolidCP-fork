This is a "fake" manifest-only, POSH module version of the [real](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AWSPowerShell) AWSPowerShell module.

The purpose of this module is to satisfy dependencies such as `RequiredModules` defined by the manifest of other modules that could be published to nuget repos such as staging.
